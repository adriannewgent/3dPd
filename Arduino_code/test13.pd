#X text 29 111 If neither sketch is able to print 13 and instead you
get a 10 \, you must change the [arduino_data] and [matrix_connections]
abstractions in the modular_synthesizer.pd patch \, with the [arduino_data13]
and [matrix_connections13] abstractions \, plus use the modular_synthesizer13.ino
Arduino sketch. The rest should work as expected.;
#X text 29 24 This very simple patch is for testing whether you can
print the number 13 from the Teensy to Pd. If you get 13 printed in
Pd's console either with the write13.ino or the print13.ino sketch
\, you're good to go with the modular_synthesizer.pd patch. Read the
README that comes with the Arduino sketches for more information;
