# modular_synthesizer

This repository hosts the code, schematics, and circuit board designs (made in Eagle freeware) for a hardware digital modular synthesizer. The audio is programmed in Pure Data and the hardware control in the Arduino language. A Teensy 3.2 is intended to be used as a micro-controller, but it is generally referred to as an Arduino)
