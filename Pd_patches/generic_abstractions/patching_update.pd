#X text 33 22 it's a bit of an overkill to have an abstraction that
just sends its input to a [send] \, but it's probably clearer to use
the patching update feature with an abstraction rather than with a
[send]. still you can just use the [send] below instead of this abstraction
\, but whichever way you do it \, you MUST send a 1 or a 0 to the [send]
below;
